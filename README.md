# WhisperTranscriptionApp

## Overview

WhisperTranscriptionApp is an advanced iOS 17+ application that enables on-device audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model, transformed into CoreML format for local processing. Designed for private and efficient transcription, this app offers continuous audio recording that operates in the background, displaying active status in iOS 17â€™s Dynamic Island and Live Activities. All transcription processing and storage are handled locally on the device to ensure a seamless, offline experience.

## Key Features

- **On-Device Real-Time Transcription**: Utilizing OpenAI's Whisper model, the app transcribes audio without requiring an internet connection.
- **Continuous Background Recording**: Users can record audio while the app is minimized or the device is locked.
- **Dynamic Island & Live Activities**: iOS 17's Dynamic Island and Live Activities are leveraged to show ongoing recording status and transcription progress.
- **Local Data Management**: Recordings and transcriptions are stored locally, allowing users to manage files directly within the app.

## Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: iOS 17+
- **Programming Language**: Swift
- **CoreML**: Pre-converted Whisper model in CoreML format

## Directory Structure

- **WhisperTranscriptionApp.xcodeproj**: Xcode project file for the app setup.
- **WhisperTranscriptionApp/**: Main application code directory.
  - **AppDelegate.swift**: Manages app lifecycle.
  - **SceneDelegate.swift**: Manages window configurations and background handling.
  - **Models/WhisperModel.mlmodel**: The CoreML-converted Whisper model.
  - **Models/WhisperModelManager.swift**: Singleton manager for loading and interfacing with the Whisper model.
  - **Views/**: Contains UI components for audio recording, transcription display, and management.
  - **ViewModels/**: Handles core logic for recording, transcription, and Dynamic Island updates.
  - **Managers/**: Classes for managing local storage of transcriptions, audio files, and Live Activities.
  - **Utilities/ErrorAlertManager.swift**: Helper for handling and displaying error messages.

## Prerequisites

- **Xcode 15** or later
- **Swift**: Latest stable version compatible with iOS 17+
- **Whisper Model**: Pre-converted to CoreML format using the provided Python script

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/WhisperTranscriptionApp.git
   ```
2. Open `WhisperTranscriptionApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Enable necessary permissions under `Info.plist`.

## Development Phases

The following 10 phases provide a highly detailed guide to assist developers in building each component of the app.

1. **Project Setup and Configuration**:  
   - Initialize the Xcode project with the appropriate settings for iOS 17+.
   - Set Swift as the primary programming language.
   - Configure the deployment target and other project settings.
   - Add necessary dependencies and frameworks, such as CoreML and AVFoundation.

2. **User Interface Design**:  
   - Design the app's UI components using SwiftUI or UIKit.
   - Create screens for onboarding, login, transcription display, and settings.
   - Ensure the UI is responsive and supports various device sizes.
   - Incorporate Dynamic Island and Live Activities UI elements.

3. **Whisper Model Integration**:  
   - Use the provided Python script to convert the OpenAI Whisper model to CoreML format.
   - Integrate the CoreML model into the app.
   - Test the model's compatibility and performance on device.

4. **Audio Recording Implementation**:  
   - Implement continuous audio recording functionality.
   - Configure `AVAudioSession` for background recording.
   - Handle microphone permissions and user prompts.
   - Ensure recording continues when the app is minimized or the device is locked.

5. **Real-Time Transcription**:  
   - Process audio input through the Whisper model for transcription.
   - Optimize for real-time performance and minimal latency.
   - Display transcribed text to the user as it's processed.
   - Handle different languages and accents if applicable.

6. **Dynamic Island & Live Activities Integration**:  
   - Leverage iOS 17 APIs to display ongoing recording status.
   - Update transcription progress in the Dynamic Island and Live Activities.
   - Ensure smooth animations and minimal impact on device resources.

7. **Local Data Storage and Management**:  
   - Implement local storage for audio recordings and transcriptions.
   - Use Core Data or file management APIs for data persistence.
   - Provide a user interface for managing saved transcriptions.
   - Implement features like search, delete, and share for transcriptions.

8. **Authentication and Onboarding**:  
   - Create onboarding screens for first-time users.
   - Implement authentication if required (e.g., Sign in with Apple).
   - Store user preferences and settings securely.
   - Guide users through granting necessary permissions.

9. **Error Handling and User Feedback**:  
   - Utilize `ErrorAlertManager` to display user-friendly error messages.
   - Handle common errors such as permission denials or model loading failures.
   - Provide feedback during long operations (e.g., loading spinners).
   - Ensure the app remains stable under unexpected conditions.

10. **Testing and Optimization**:  
    - Write unit tests and UI tests to cover key functionalities.
    - Optimize the app for performance and battery efficiency.
    - Profile the app to identify and fix memory leaks or bottlenecks.
    - Prepare the app for App Store submission by adhering to guidelines.
